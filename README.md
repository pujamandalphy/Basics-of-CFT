# Two-Dimensional Conformal Field Theory (CFT\_2) — Prerequisite Study

This repository contains an independent prerequisite study on two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT\_2), with a focus on the free boson and basic Virasoro/CFT structure. The project is intended as preparation for AdS\_3/CFT\_2 and related topics in quantum field theory and gravity. It was **guided and reviewed by Dr. Samrat Bhowmik (SPPU)**.

## Scope

The notes aim to build a minimal but solid foundation in CFT\_2, covering in particular:

- QFT and path integral basics (in QM and QFT)  
- Symmetries, Noether’s theorem, and conserved currents  
- Free scalar and spinor fields  
- The free boson in two dimensions (plane and cylinder)  
- Stress-energy tensor in 2D and its properties  
- Operator product expansions (OPEs) and short-distance behavior  
- Virasoro algebra, central charge, and primary fields  
- Basic two-point and three-point functions in CFT\_2
